                Doctor Jonathan Russel stands out indeed, dressed in a typical brown English raincoat, a hat, a small bag in one hand, and an umbrella — an umbrella of all things — in the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Where did you think you’d travel to?” I ask him.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh it was raining in the UK when I boarded the plane, I had almost no time to prepare, so here I am, but how about we skip the smalltalk?”
            </p>
            <p>
                We sit down, and he continues.
            </p>
            <p>
                “On the phone I told you I’m a doctor at the Sheffield Institute of Interspatial Communication. Have you heard of it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                I shake my head but let the doctor continue.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Naturally,” he replies. “The institute was founded five years ago, so it makes sense that you haven’t heard of it, I believe you were still travelling back then. At the Institute, we’re concerned with the study of long-distance space travel and communication; and, well, everything related to it. I particularly, am working on a study about possible ways of dealing with time dilation — a concept you’re fairly familiar with, I reckon; given that you’ve made it into your job.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I nod.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Now, part of my study involves a practical test, flying to a specific point in space, and back. I’m looking for a pilot.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I interrupt him. “Look, I just came back from a trip, and plan to stay for a year or two. If you want to, we can schedule a trip two years from now, but I’m sure you’ll find other taxis that are available to leave earlier.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, here’s the problem. No one wants to take me.”
            </p>

            That last chapter had me on the edge of my seat. Great story, and I really enjoyed the writing as well! It painted every scene very nicely, and the characters are super interesting

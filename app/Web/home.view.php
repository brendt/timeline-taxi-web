    <p class="p-2">A throbbing pain wakes me up as it shoots from my lower arm up to my shoulder. My first instinct is to reach for whatever’s hurting my arm, but I recover fast enough to know that I shouldn’t. It’s been centuries since the invention of deep sleep, yet we still need pain stimuli to wake from it. Why no one has bothered to come up with a better way than shooting electroshocks through an arm is beyond me. I turn right and Mr. Tunaki is still strapped in firmly, deep asleep. Just the way I left him. I turn to the dashboard in front of me; both our vitals are good. Speed is nominal, 99.995% c. We’re two days worth of travel time out from Earth. All is good. I remove the probe from my arm as I stare into the blueshifted space in front of me. Just the way I left it.</p>
